# Multi-Class_Prediction_of_Cirrhosis_Outcomes
This a work in progress.
Multi-class prediction of cirrhosis outcomes. The data is a part of Kaggle competition 
Competition closed before I was able to finish the project completly. I through together a couple models and submitted just to be on the leader board. 
Scored about 50 percentile on submissions. 
Future work on this project I would spend some more time looking at feature selection and try some more complex models. Maybe slklearns neural network.
